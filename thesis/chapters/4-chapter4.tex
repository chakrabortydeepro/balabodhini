\chapter{Bhaṭṭa Jagaddhara and Śitikaṇṭha}

This chapter primarily provides a biographical account of Jagaddhara and Śitikaṇṭha, the authors of the texts edited in this thesis. They are both notable Kashmiri authors from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, respectively.

\section{Jagaddhara and Śitikaṇṭha's Time}

Jagaddhara made no mention of his date in his works. However, Śitikaṇṭha clearly indicated the ruler of Kashmir at the time he composed the \emph{nyāsa} and specified the exact date of completing the first half of the text (\emph{pūrvārdha}). Moreover, he states his familial relationship with Jagaddhara, which assists us in determining Jagaddhara's date.

Śitikaṇṭha initiated his \emph{nyāsa} with 11 preliminary verses, concluding with praise for Sultan Hassan Shah, the son of Haider Shah, under whose reign he composed the \emph{nyāsa}.
